# Options Simulator

Welcome to the Options Simulator, a web application built using React JS that allows users to simulate various options trading strategies and analyze their potential outcomes.

## Features

The Options Simulator offers the following major features:

1. **Straddle Simulator**: Simulate a straddle options trading strategy by inputting strike prices and expiration date. Visualize the potential profit and loss outcomes of a straddle strategy using interactive charts. This feature helps users understand how their strategy performs across a range of underlying index prices.

2. **Straddle Chart**: View the potential profit and loss outcomes of a straddle strategy through read-only charts. This feature helps users understand how their strategy performs across a range of underlying asset prices.

3. **Strangle Chart**: Similar to the straddle chart, this feature allows users to view the potential outcomes of a strangle options strategy through read-only charts. Input strike prices for both the call and put options, and the simulator will generate charts showing potential profit and loss scenarios.

4. **Journal**: Keep track of your trading activities and strategies using the journal feature. You can record trade details, observations, and notes to maintain a record of your trading decisions and outcomes. Import and export your journal entries for easy backup and sharing.
